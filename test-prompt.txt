## Example prompt with file paths

I need help debugging the issue in src/autotouch_chat/services/tool_dispatcher.py where the EntityExtractor is failing. 

The error seems to be coming from the agent_service.py file when it calls the find_similar_companies function.

Can you also check:
- src/autotouch_chat/services/agent_service.py
- src/utils/entity_extractor.py
- tests/test_tool_dispatcher.py

And maybe look at the config in config/settings.json
